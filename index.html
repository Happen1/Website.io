    <p>>If you believe that someone is missing then please contact your local police station. Dial 18555 and inform them you would like to make a missing persons report, alternatively you can attend your local police station. It is a common belief that you
      have to wait 24 hours before reporting but this is not true, you can make a report to the police as soon as you think a person is missing.</p>
